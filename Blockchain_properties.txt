Anonimity:
    ● Literally: Without a name
        ○ Crypto Currencies uses hashes of public keys
        ○ They don't use a name, then it is anonymous?
    ● Cryptocurrencies are Pseudo-Anonymous
        ○ No Real Names
        ○ But traces of activity!
    ● Anonymity for us is two things:
        ○ Pseudo Anonymity
        ○ Unlinkability
    ■ Different interactions should not link pseudo anonymous identities

    Pseudo-anonymity versus anonymity:
        ● Pseudo-anonymity:
            ○ Choose a random address
                ■ If you use it all the time, it leaves a trace
                ■ Can be linked to you if someone saw you using it
                ■ Can relate with other off-chain information
        ● Anonymity:
            ○ Choose a random address every time
                ■ Very difficult to manage
                ■ There are still correlations that can be created
                ● You need to change IP address too!
                ■ Much stronger than pseudo anonymity
    
        ● What is Unlinkability in Cryptocurrencies?
            ○ Difficult to link different addresses to same person
            ○ Difficult to link different transactions to same person
            ○ Difficult to link sender and receiver

        ● Why is it so difficult?
            ○ Exchanges use KYC (Know Your Customer) standard
            ○ Things can be deanonymised using side channels
            ○ Link between physical and address
            ○ Profiling is reasonably easy these days
    
        ● Having complete unlikability is very hard (almost impossible)
            ○ There will always be some loose string
            ○ Even in law the definition is not that fierce
            ■ GDPR
            ■ LGPD

        ● We compute what we call Anonymity Set:
            ○ It is the crowd we blend in
            ○ We characterise it
            ○ Define a threat model
            ○ Determine what the attacker knows, what he don't and what her can't
        
        Why do people want anonymity?
            ● Transactions are public
                ○ Blockchain means no privacy on transactions
                ○ There is much less privacy than in the traditional system
                    ■ No big bank to hide your nasty business
            
            ● Anonymity is necessary for some lawfull cases

            ● The main problem is that it can also be used for money laundering:
                ○ We still need hard cash
                ○ Access to it is regulated
                ○ So anonymity does not pose a big problem to law enforcement
                    ■ Other than having to hire guys that actually know how it works
        
        Anonymity in E-cash/ Crypto Currencies
            ● Bitcoin was not first!
                ○ E-cash predates crypto-currencies
                    ■ Trust the bank!
                
                ○ Chaum's e-cash blind signatures protocol, 1992
                    ■ Uses homomorphisms for that
                    ■ Has its use not only in e-cash, but also in elections.

                ○ Chaum's protocol works like:
                    ■ Choose a random number and blind it
                    ■ Ask for the bank to withdraw. Bank attached a value to the blinded number and signs it
                    ■ You pass the coin on with the unblinded number
                    ■ Receiver deposits. The bank checks his signature and the value
                    ■ Bank pays for the coin and keeps track of double spending
        
        Anonymity versus Decentralization
            ● Interactive protocols are hard to decentralise
            ● You need to do it in public
                ○ Blockchains
                ○ Then you allow for traces
            ● E-Cash works over a different set of assumptions
            ● Unlinkability is more difficult due to public transactions
        
        What are the best practices for anonymity in Bitcoin?
            ● Always use fresh addresses
                ○ Specially for receiving
            
            ● They are easy to generate
            ● Easy to throw away
                ○ You only keep those you transacted
            
            ● They are pseudo anonymous

            How to deanonymize bitcoin?
                ● If you use multiple addresses, you will have your money spread
                ● You will need to use two wallets to generate a transaction
                    ○ Bigger output than the inputs alone
                ● If two source wallest appear on the same transaction we can infer they belong to the same person
                ● We can do it transitively
                ● We clan cluster together the addresses that belong to the same person
                    ○ The more one trancats the clearer it is

                    ● This is how people find the addresses of exchanges to attack
                    ● To confirm who your guess is just do one transaction with the possible ones then you confirm
                    ● We can also map the change address for the transaction even if used only once
                    ● But this adds some unlinkability
                        ○ Gives false positives
                
                ● You will always flow towards a cluster
                ● Law enforcement can identify you on the regulated side
                ● Carelessness
                    ○ Publishing address in forums!
                
                ● Bitcoin has a P2P layer
                    ○ It uses IP addresses
                ● First to broadcast is probably the source of the transaction
                ● You can link that IP to a physical address
                    ○ How law enforcement do for other things
       
                ● Solution:
                    ○ Use a Mix Net
                    ○ In practice people user TOR
                
                Mix Nets
                    ● Know for a long time for election protocols
                    ● The idea is to put everything in the same sack and take it out randomly
                    ● Should not keep records
                    ● Should not ask for identities
                    ● Are the basis for TOR
                    ● In the sense of Cryptocurrencies the lack of trust is a problem
                        ○ Should I put my money on someone's bag?
                
                    - implementation of Mix Nets in Cryptocurrencies
                        ● Must have some properties
                            ○ Same size in and out
                            ○ Have a standard API
                            ○ Charge fees on all or nothing basis
                            ○ Be trusted

                        ● They are used as a bag to do the swaps
                        ● Similar to TOR
                        ● You can chain them
                            ○ More anonymity, but more cost
                        ● One implementation is Mixcoin from Joe Bonneau
                            ○ Zcash
                            ○ Monero
