            Launched in 2015;
            
                Private and Permissioned;
                Membership Service Provider (MSP):
                    PKI with X.509 certificates: Fabric CA, External CA.
                    Actors: peers, orderes, administrators, client aplications...
                    IDEMix: Provides pseudo-anonimity.
            
            Channels: Communication | Ledger : World State(DB), LevelDB, CouchDB | Chaincode: Go, Node and Java | Consensus: Raft, Kafka and Solo | Privacy: Channels, Data collections, Encrypted Data

            NETWORK ELEMENTS:
                Components: 
                    Chain codes | Channels | Network config file | Ledger | Peers |

                Entities:
                    Organizations | Orderer | Certification authorities | Consortium
            
            What does a network need to have?
                Orderer;
                Network Configuration;
                Channel;

            How does creating a network work?

                Can be created independently.
                
                Identification through DNS or IP address in digital certificates.

                Each node on the network needs to have acopy of the "sysconfig ledger".
            
                Elements:
                    Network configuration
                        Is the first block.
                        Configures the network.
                        Elements network.
                        Informations.
                        Settings.
                    
                    Organization:
                        Defined in the network configuration.
                        
                        Organizations under same Network Configuration:
                            same permissions.
                        
                        Groups ofparticipants.

                        Orderer:
                            Configurations necessary for transactio consensus.

                            Will admit the entry of new participants.
                    
                    Consortium:    
                        Two or more network organizations.
                        
                        Transact data with each other.

                        Form a consortium with permissions.

                        Own objective.

                        Approves transactions.

                    Channel:
                        Isolation and confidentiality of data.
                        
                        Communicates to connect network components.

                        Has its own settings.

                        Are independent:
                            not governed by the network.
                            not affected by changes to
                            Network Configuration.

                    Channel configuration:
                        Channels generate configuration block.

                        Check the peer'spermission: 
                            reading or writing information to the ledger.
                    
                    Peer
                        Copy of the ledger.
                        Anchor peers:
                            execute smart contract transactions.
    
                        Leading peers:
                            validate blocks of ordered transactions.

                    Chain code
                        Installed and instantiated on a peer before a client application can invoke it.

                        Define access to the ledger; 
                        
                        Functions to read info from the ledger and update the information.

                    Ledger
                        Stores the transactions and states of the chain code
                        
                        Physically hosted on the peer.
                        
                        Logically belongs to the channel.
                    
                    Certificate authority
                        Allows to establish access permissions.
                        
                        Issue certificates to authenticate organizations.

                        Network can have 1 or more. 
                        
                        Organizations can use their own CA.
                    
                    Client application:
                        Use certificates to authenticate transaction proposals.
                        Construct transactions.


                TRANSACTION FLOW:
                    Transaction request TP1:
                        verified by A1
                            chaincode -> function -> parameter.
                        
                        with MSP.
                            verify identity.
                            verify application permissions

                            Permisions of R1:
                                request modifications.
                                request readings in L1
                                    Verifies:
                                        identity
                                        authorization
                        
                        ordered transactions create blocks

                        Update their copy of the ledger with this new block.

                        The new block is added to the blockchain structure
